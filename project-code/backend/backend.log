This React application includes a **Login Page** and a **Dashboard Page** with simple navigation between them.

## **2. Functional Requirements**  
1. Users should see a **Login Page** when opening the app.  
2. The **Login Page** has:
   - Email and Password input fields.  
   - A "Login" button (disabled if fields are empty).  
   - A "Sign Up" link that navigates to the **Sign Up Page**.  
3. After clicking "Login," the user is redirected to the **Dashboard**.  
4. The **Dashboard Page** contains:  
   - A "Welcome" message.  
   - A "Logout" button that redirects back to the **Login Page**.  

## **3. UI Requirements**  
- Simple and **responsive** UI using **React + CSS**.  
- **Centered login form** with a blue "Login" button.  
- **Navigation:**  
  - Clicking "Login" \u2192 Redirects to **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`).  
  - Clicking "Logout" \u2192 Redirects to **Login** (`/`).  
  - Clicking "Sign Up" \u2192 Redirects to **Sign Up Page** (`/signup`).  

## **4. Navigation & Routing**  
- Use **React Router** for navigation.  
- Routes:  
  - `/` \u2192 Login Page  
  - `/dashboard` \u2192 Dashboard Page  
  - `/signup` \u2192 Sign Up Page  

## **5. State Management**  
- Use **useState()** to store login form inputs.  
- Store login status in **React Context API** or **local state**.  

## **6. Error Handling**  
- Show a message if email or password fields are empty.  
- Show an **error alert** if login fails (dummy validation).  

## **7. Additional Notes**  
- Ensure mobile **responsiveness** using **CSS Flexbox/Grid**.  
- Basic validation: Allow login if **any non-empty input** is entered.

As a user, I want to access a visually appealing and user-friendly dashboard after logging in, so that I can see a personalized welcome message and easily log out when needed.

Acceptance Criteria:
For UI Design & Layout, the dashboard should have a modern, clean, and responsive design. A welcome message should be displayed at the top, greeting the user by name. Example: "Welcome, John Doe!" A logout button should be placed at the top-right corner for easy access. The main dashboard area should be well-structured with a light-themed or dark-themed UI option.

Navigation & Features:
The welcome message should dynamically update based on the logged-in user’s name. The logout button should be styled as a simple and elegant button (e.g., a small rounded button with an icon). Clicking the logout button should: Prompt a confirmation modal: "Are you sure you want to log out?" If confirmed, log out the user and redirect them to the Login Page.

Functional Requirements
The dashboard should detect and display the logged-in user’s first name dynamically. The UI should be fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile screens. If a user is not logged in and tries to access the dashboard, they should be redirected to the Login Page automatically.

As a user, I want to access a visually appealing and user-friendly dashboard after logging in, so that I can see a personalized welcome message and easily log out when needed.

Acceptance Criteria:
For UI Design & Layout, the dashboard should have a modern, clean, and responsive design. A welcome message should be displayed at the top, greeting the user by name. Example: "Welcome, John Doe!" A logout button should be placed at the top-right corner for easy access. The main dashboard area should be well-structured with a light-themed or dark-themed UI option.

Navigation & Features:
The welcome message should dynamically update based on the logged-in user\u0393ÇÖs name. The logout button should be styled as a simple and elegant button (e.g., a small rounded button with an icon). Clicking the logout button should: Prompt a confirmation modal: "Are you sure you want to log out?" If confirmed, log out the user and redirect them to the Login Page.

Functional Requirements
The dashboard should detect and display the logged-in user\u0393ÇÖs first name dynamically. The UI should be fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile screens. If a user is not logged in and tries to access the dashboard, they should be redirected to the Login Page automatically.
